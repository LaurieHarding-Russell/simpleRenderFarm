# What is this?
This is simple hacked together render farm for blender.
No auth like flameanco.
Open source unlike render-crowed.

# Why?
I wanted a simple solution for local hardware and I like having source code.


# How do I run it locally?
1. `docker build -t blender-image .`
2. Go into `master/client` run `yarn build` (9FIXME, move to bazel once angular 9)
3. Run `bazel run //master:master`
